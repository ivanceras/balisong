Balisong is a Voxel renderer using raytracing writen in Rust.


This is an improved version of [![ivancerust]](https://github.com/ivanceras/ivancerust), which I already did pick a name.



This is faster since it is now using Voxel Octree, therefore checking whether a node in the octree is occupied is blazingly fast.


How fast:?
